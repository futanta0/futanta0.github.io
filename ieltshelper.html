    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard to provide a seamless, non-linear user experience. The core architecture consists of a sticky top navigation bar for direct access to key IELTS topics (Education, Technology, Health, etc.) and a dynamic main content area. The default view presents an overview and topic selection cards. Clicking a topic card or a nav link reveals a detailed section for that topic. This structure was chosen to transform the dense, linear report into an explorable resource. Users can either browse topics sequentially or jump directly to a specific area of interest. Within each topic, content is further organized into interactive modules: a filterable question bank, tabbed vocabulary lists, and an interactive chart for exploring arguments. This layered, task-oriented design prioritizes user control and makes the vast amount of information manageable and easy to synthesize. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Positive/Negative arguments for each topic. -> Goal: Compare the two sides and allow users to explore the details. Viz/Presentation Method: A horizontal bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) visually anchors the section, showing the number of positive vs. negative ideas. This is paired with a dynamic text area. -> Interaction: Clicking on a bar in the chart (e.g., "Positive Ideas") populates the text area with the detailed arguments for that category. -> Justification: This interactive pairing is more engaging than a static table. It encourages active exploration and breaks down complex information into digestible chunks, supporting the app's goal of user-driven learning. -> Library/Method: Chart.js on a Canvas element, with a custom `onClick` event handler to update the DOM. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    prompt: "Some people believe that public health is the government's responsibility, while others think people should be responsible for their own health. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
                    essay: `<p class="mb-4">In contemporary society, the question of whether public health is a matter of governmental responsibility or personal accountability is a subject of considerable debate. While advocates for a more interventionist state argue that governments have a duty to ensure public well-being, others assert that individual autonomy in health-related choices is paramount. A comprehensive approach, which recognizes the pivotal roles of both the state and the individual, is the most effective way forward.</p><p class="mb-4">On the one hand, a strong case can be made for governmental intervention in public health. The state is uniquely positioned to implement policies on a large scale that can significantly influence societal health outcomes. For instance, national healthcare systems ensure that even the most vulnerable members of society have access to essential medical services, thereby promoting equity in health. Furthermore, governments can enforce regulations on harmful substances, such as implementing a sugar tax on carbonated beverages, which has been shown to reduce consumption and prevent chronic ailments. This approach is based on the premise that collective action is necessary to address systemic issues and protect the populace from commercial interests that may undermine public well-being.</p><p class="mb-4">On the other hand, it is equally important to acknowledge the role of individual responsibility. Proponents of this view argue that without personal accountability, government efforts can be rendered ineffective. Individuals are ultimately the ones who make daily choices about their diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits. A person who is not committed to self-discipline and healthy living can easily circumvent regulations or ignore public health campaigns. This viewpoint emphasizes that true, lasting change must be cultivated from within, as it is individuals who have the final say over their own lives and bodies.</p><p>In conclusion, while both the government and individuals play significant roles in promoting public health, a collaborative approach that leverages the strengths of both is the most logical path. Governments should provide the necessary infrastructure and implement effective policies to educate the public and curb harmful practices. However, individuals must take responsibility for their own well-being by actively making informed lifestyle choices. It is only through this partnership that a healthier and more resilient society can be achieved.</p>`,

                    prompt: "The increasing frequency of satellite launches and space debris is becoming a threat to the Earth. What are the main causes? What measures can be taken to address this issue?",
                    essay: `<p class="mb-4">The proliferation of satellites and the resulting increase in space debris represent a pressing issue that poses a significant threat to global space activities. This problem is rooted in a confluence of technological and economic factors, and its remediation will require a concerted, multi-pronged approach encompassing both policy and technological innovation.</p><p class="mb-4">The primary cause of the current predicament is the "new space race," which is driven not by government ambition but by the privatization of the space industry. Commercial entities, motivated by the pursuit of profit and the ambition to provide global connectivity, are launching "mega-constellations" of satellites into low Earth orbit at an unprecedented rate. This trend, coupled with the historical lack of foresight in designing satellites without a reliable end-of-life plan, has created a ticking time bomb. The problem is compounded by a lack of a unified global authority to regulate this shared resource, leading to a "tragedy of the cosmic commons" where individual actors pollute the orbital environment with impunity.</p><p class="mb-4">To mitigate this looming threat, a range of measures must be undertaken. First and foremost, new international legislation is essential to impose stricter regulations on satellite launches and the disposal of defunct objects. A fundamental step is to mandate that all new satellites include a reliable, on-board de-orbiting mechanism to ensure they can be removed from orbit at the end of their operational life. To enforce this, a "space tax" could be levied on launches, with the revenue allocated to funding "active debris removal" missions. Additionally, there is a pressing need for the development of a comprehensive, real-time "space traffic management" system, similar to air traffic control, to track all orbital objects and prevent future collisions.</p><p>In conclusion, the problem of space debris is a direct consequence of a lack of foresight and a fragmented regulatory framework in the face of rapid technological advancement. Addressing this issue requires a holistic approach that combines strict legislative mandates with a commitment to technological innovation. By prioritizing space stewardship and global cooperation, it is possible to clean up the orbital environment and safeguard its use for humanity's future.</p>`,

                    essay: `<p class="mb-4">In many nations, the conversation surrounding public health often revolves around the allocation of funds towards treatment. However, an increasingly prevalent view is that a focus on preventing illness is far more effective. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree with this notion, as a proactive approach to health not only reduces the societal burden of disease but also fosters a more resilient and productive population.</p><p class="mb-4">The primary argument for prioritizing preventative medicine is its profound long-term impact. Treating chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes places an immense and often unsustainable financial strain on national healthcare systems. By contrast, investing in public health initiatives—such as campaigns to promote healthy eating, physical activity, and regular check-ups—can address the root causes of these illnesses before they manifest. This proactive approach is a more fiscally responsible and humane strategy, as it mitigates human suffering and reduces the need for expensive, long-term care.</p><p class="mb-4">Furthermore, a focus on prevention empowers individuals and cultivates a culture of personal accountability. When the public is equipped with the knowledge and resources to make informed lifestyle choices, they are more likely to take an active role in their own well-being. For instance, the promotion of community-based solutions, such as pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and public parks, encourages citizens to adopt a more active and less sedentary lifestyle. This societal shift towards proactive health management, when supported by governmental policies, creates a synergy that is far more powerful than a system that merely reacts to illness after it occurs.</p><p>In conclusion, while the treatment of illness will always remain a vital component of any healthcare system, the focus must shift to prevention. The benefits of this approach—from reducing the societal burden of disease to empowering individuals and fostering a healthier culture—are a compelling argument for its prioritization. It is only through a dedicated commitment to preventative medicine that we can build a truly resilient and healthy society for the future.</p>`,
