      <h2>General Tips and Collocations</h2>
      <p>
        This section provides overarching guidance for achieving band 9 in IELTS Writing Task 2. Success hinges on having a clear opinion,
        developing ideas logically, using a wide range of academic vocabulary and collocations, and structuring your essay effectively. Always
        analyse the question carefully, decide what type of essay it is, and plan your thesis statement and topic sentences before writing.
      </p>
      <h3>Writing Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analyse the task:</strong> identify whether you need to give an opinion, discuss both views, solve a problem, or evaluate pros and cons.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan before you write:</strong> take a few minutes to brainstorm ideas and organise them into paragraphs. Quality matters more than quantity.</li>
        <li><strong>Use cohesive devices:</strong> link your sentences and paragraphs logically using connectors like <em>furthermore</em>, <em>however</em>, <em>for example</em>, and <em>therefore</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance your position:</strong> present both sides where appropriate but make sure your own stance is clear.</li>
        <li><strong>Check your work:</strong> leave time to proof‑read for grammar errors, inappropriate word choice or repetition.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Useful Collocations and Phrases</h3>
      <p>
        Familiarity with common word pairings will make your writing sound more natural. Here are some collocations that can be used across
        almost any topic:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Play a pivotal role:</strong> to have a very important influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Address the root cause:</strong> tackle the fundamental reason for a problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote sustainable development:</strong> encourage growth that does not damage the environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Strive for equality:</strong> work hard towards fairness or equal rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement effective measures:</strong> put in place actions that work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Alleviate the burden:</strong> make a difficulty or problem easier to bear.</li>
        <li><strong>Foster innovation:</strong> encourage creativity and new ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain social cohesion:</strong> keep society united and stable.</li>

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Government should invest more money in scientific research. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Scientific research underpins progress in health, technology and the environment.  Government funding ensures that projects serving
          the public interest, not just commercial gain, are pursued.
        </p>
        <p>
          I therefore agree that public investment in science is essential.  Private companies may focus on profit, whereas state funding can
          support fundamental research and ensure that discoveries are shared for the benefit of all.
        </p>

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Lack of funding for scientific research. What problems does this cause and what solutions exist?</p>
        <p>
          Insufficient funding slows down innovation and can cause scientists to move abroad.  Promising projects may be abandoned, delaying
          breakthroughs in medicine and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments can increase grants and offer tax incentives for private investment.  Public‑private partnerships can pool resources.
          Encouraging interest in STEM fields will also expand the research workforce.  These measures can ensure science continues to advance.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Tourism brings more benefits than drawbacks. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Tourism generates income and jobs and promotes cross‑cultural understanding.  Many countries rely on tourism for economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, mass tourism can damage environments and dilute culture.  I believe that while tourism has many advantages, it
          should be managed sustainably to minimise harm.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Overtourism in popular destinations is causing problems. What are they and how can they be solved?</p>
        <p>
          Overtourism leads to overcrowding, environmental degradation and rising prices for locals.  Heritage sites may be damaged by
          excessive foot traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments can limit visitor numbers and spread tourists over lesser‑known attractions.  Investing in infrastructure and
          encouraging off‑season travel can also alleviate pressure.  Educating tourists about respectful behaviour will further reduce
          negative impacts.

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Vegetarian diets are healthier than diets including meat. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Vegetarians argue that plant‑based diets lower the risk of heart disease and reduce environmental impact.  They claim meat is
          unnecessary for nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, meat provides essential nutrients like iron and vitamin B12.  A balanced diet can include moderate meat consumption.
          In my view, the healthiest diet is varied and includes plenty of plant foods, whether or not meat is consumed.

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Food waste is increasing in many countries. What are the causes and what can be done?</p>
        <p>
          Consumers buy more than they need and throw away edible food.  Supermarkets discard imperfect produce due to aesthetics.  This waste
          squanders resources and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments can run campaigns to change consumer habits and implement legislation encouraging supermarkets to donate unsold food.
          Individuals can plan meals and store food properly.  By valuing food, we reduce waste and protect the planet.

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Capital punishment should be abolished. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Opponents of the death penalty argue that it is irreversible and that miscarriages of justice can lead to innocent people being
          executed.  They also claim that capital punishment does not deter crime more effectively than life imprisonment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree that the death penalty should be abolished.  Modern justice systems should aim to rehabilitate rather than kill.  Life
          sentences protect society without violating human rights, and mistakes can be corrected if new evidence emerges.

          financial loss and national security threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments should invest in cybersecurity and enact strict laws against hacking.  Individuals must use strong passwords and
          update software.  International cooperation is essential to track criminals across borders.  Education about online safety can
          also reduce victims’ vulnerability.

          Some argue that public funds should be spent on health and education rather than art.  They believe that the arts are a luxury

        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Schools can promote reading by introducing engaging texts and library programmes.  Parents should model reading at home.  Digital

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Professional athletes are paid too much. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Critics argue that athletes earn disproportionate salaries compared with teachers or nurses.  They contend that sports are a form
          of entertainment and do not justify multimillion‑dollar contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, athletes have short careers and face intense competition and physical risk.  Their earnings reflect market demand and
          the revenue they generate.  Therefore, while pay disparities exist, high salaries in sport are justifiable in the context of
          entertainment economies.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Many children do not get enough physical exercise. What problems does this cause and how can it be solved?</p>
        <p>
          Lack of exercise contributes to obesity, poor fitness and mental health problems among children.  Sedentary habits set patterns
          that continue into adulthood, increasing healthcare costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schools should provide daily physical education and offer a variety of sports to appeal to different interests.  Parents can
          limit screen time and encourage outdoor play.  Community programmes and safe parks also make it easier for children to be active.

      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Living in cities offers a better quality of life than living in the countryside. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          City life offers convenience, cultural activities and better employment prospects.  Urban dwellers enjoy access to education,
          healthcare and entertainment that may be lacking in rural areas.  However, cities also suffer from pollution, high living costs
          and anonymity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I believe that quality of life depends on individual preferences.  Some thrive in the dynamic environment of a city,
          while others value the tranquillity and community of rural life.  Therefore, neither option is universally superior; people should
          choose what suits their lifestyle.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Housing affordability is a growing issue. What problems does it cause and what solutions can you suggest?</p>
        <p>
          Expensive housing forces families into cramped conditions or long commutes, affecting their quality of life and health.  It can
          also exacerbate homelessness and widen the gap between rich and poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments can address this by subsidising construction of affordable homes, implementing rent controls and encouraging mixed‑income
          developments.  Improving public transport can also allow people to live in less expensive areas.  These measures will help make
          housing more accessible.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Parents should be solely responsible for teaching their children how to be good members of society. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Some argue that parents are best placed to instil moral values because they spend the most time with their children.  They believe
          that a child’s character is shaped at home and that relying on schools or society can lead to mixed messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I partly agree.  Parents play a critical role, but schools and communities also contribute to socialisation.  Teachers can model
          respect and cooperation, and peer interactions teach empathy.  A collaborative approach between parents, educators and society
          ensures that children receive consistent guidance on how to behave ethically.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Many children lead sedentary lifestyles due to technology. What problems does this cause and how can it be resolved?</p>
        <p>
          Sedentary habits contribute to obesity and poor physical health.  Children who spend hours on screens may develop social isolation
          and have shorter attention spans.  Lack of exercise can also affect mood and cognitive development.
        </p>
        <p>
          To counter this, parents should set limits on screen time and encourage outdoor activities.  Schools can integrate physical education
          and active breaks into the curriculum.  Community programmes that offer sports and play areas can make physical activity enjoyable.
          By creating supportive environments, children will be more likely to lead active lifestyles.

      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Censorship is necessary in modern society. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
        <p>
          Advocates of censorship argue that restricting harmful content protects vulnerable audiences and maintains social harmony.
          They point to hate speech, violence and pornography as areas where regulation is justified.  Moreover, during crises, governments
          may need to limit misinformation to ensure public safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, censorship can easily be abused to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression.  History shows that regimes often
          censor criticism under the guise of public order.  In my view, while some regulation of content is necessary, especially to
          protect children, safeguards must be in place to prevent censorship from infringing fundamental rights.

      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Fake news is widespread. What problems does this cause and how can it be tackled?</p>
        <p>
          Fake news undermines trust in legitimate journalism and can incite panic or prejudice.  For example, false medical information
          can harm public health, and fabricated political stories can influence elections.  The rapid spread of misinformation online
          makes it difficult for people to discern truth from falsehood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tackling fake news requires media literacy education so that citizens can critically evaluate sources.  Social media platforms
          should use fact‑checking services and flag dubious content.  Governments and independent regulators can establish guidelines
          that penalise deliberate spreaders of disinformation while protecting free speech.  Through a combination of education and
          responsible regulation, the impact of fake news can be mitigated.

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Globalisation is damaging local cultures. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
        <p>
          Critics of globalisation argue that international brands and media erode traditional customs.  Young people may abandon local
          languages and clothing in favour of global trends.  They fear that cultural homogenisation will result in a bland, uniform world.
        </p>
        <p>
          While globalisation poses challenges, I believe it can enrich local cultures if managed carefully.  Exposure to other cultures
          encourages creativity and innovation.  Furthermore, global networks make it easier to promote and preserve heritage on an
          international stage.  The key is to support local artists and protect cultural sites while embracing beneficial influences.

      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Endangered languages are disappearing. What problems does this cause and what measures can be taken?</p>
        <p>
          The loss of languages means the loss of unique worldviews and cultural knowledge.  When a language dies, traditional stories,
          songs and oral history vanish.  This diminishes human diversity and deprives future generations of rich heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this, governments and communities should document and teach endangered languages in schools.  Media programmes and
          technology can support language learning through apps and recordings.  Encouraging young people to speak their ancestral tongue
          and providing funding for language projects can help preserve linguistic diversity.

      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Job satisfaction is more important than salary. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Many people argue that a fulfilling job brings greater happiness than a high salary.  They point out that money cannot compensate for
          boredom or stress.  Doing work that you are passionate about can enhance your self‑esteem and overall quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I acknowledge that financial security is important, I agree that job satisfaction should take priority.  A generous salary may
          motivate employees in the short term, but without intrinsic interest their performance and mental health may suffer.  Ultimately,
          working in a role that matches your values and skills leads to long‑term success and well‑being.

      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Youth unemployment is a serious issue. What problems does it cause and what solutions can you suggest?</p>
        <p>
          High youth unemployment results in wasted potential and increases the risk of poverty and crime.  Young people who cannot find work
          may become disillusioned and experience mental health problems.  This can lead to social instability and lost economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          To tackle this issue, governments and businesses should invest in vocational training and apprenticeship programmes that equip young
          people with practical skills.  Career counselling in schools can help students make informed decisions about their futures.  Tax
          incentives for companies that hire young workers could also encourage employment.  By implementing these measures, societies can
          harness the energy and creativity of their youth.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Governments should tax sugary drinks to reduce obesity. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>
          Supporters of a tax on sugary beverages argue that it would discourage consumption and generate revenue for health programmes.  Sugary drinks
          are a major contributor to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, especially among young people.  By increasing prices, governments can
          nudge consumers towards healthier choices and fund public health initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opponents claim that such a tax is paternalistic and unfair to low‑income households.  They also note that obesity is multifaceted,
          involving sedentary lifestyles and poor diets beyond sugary drinks.  In my view, a moderate tax on sugary beverages, coupled with
          education campaigns and subsidies for healthy foods, could be an effective component of a broader strategy to combat obesity.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Obesity is increasing worldwide. What problems does this cause and how can it be addressed?</p>
        <p>
          The rising prevalence of obesity has severe health and economic consequences.  Overweight individuals are at greater risk of heart disease,
          stroke and diabetes, leading to reduced quality of life and premature death.  Healthcare systems must allocate more resources to treat
          obesity‑related conditions, diverting funds from other priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tackling obesity requires a multifaceted approach.  Governments can regulate advertising of unhealthy food to children and provide
          nutritional information on packaging.  Schools and workplaces should encourage physical activity through facilities and programmes.
          Most importantly, public health campaigns should educate people about balanced diets and the dangers of excessive calorie intake.  By
          implementing such measures, societies can reverse the obesity trend and improve overall health.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> It is the responsibility of the government to provide healthcare for all citizens. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
        <p>
          Many argue that access to healthcare is a fundamental right and that governments should therefore fund universal healthcare systems.
          Proponents point out that a healthy population contributes to economic productivity and social stability.  They also note that
          healthcare costs can be catastrophic for individuals, pushing families into poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree that governments should ensure healthcare for all.  While private providers have a role to play, relying solely on market
          forces leaves many without adequate care.  Public funding spreads the cost across society, ensuring that everyone, regardless of
          income, can receive treatment.  Universal healthcare can be financed through progressive taxation, and the benefits — a healthier,
          more equitable society — far outweigh the costs.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Corruption remains a major problem in many countries. What issues does this cause and what can be done?</p>
        <p>
          Corruption erodes public trust, distorts public spending and undermines the rule of law.  When officials accept bribes or abuse
          their positions, resources are diverted from essential services like healthcare and education.  This exacerbates inequality and
          discourages foreign investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tackling corruption requires both strong institutions and cultural change.  Governments should establish independent anti‑corruption
          agencies, implement transparent procurement systems and protect whistleblowers.  Education campaigns can promote ethical behaviour
          among public servants, while civil society and the media must be free to hold leaders accountable.  Through these measures,
          corruption can be reduced and public confidence restored.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Economic growth is more important than protecting the environment. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
        <p>
          Some people argue that rapid economic growth should take precedence over environmental considerations.  They point to the need to
          create jobs, reduce poverty and raise living standards.  Developing countries in particular may see environmental protection as a
          luxury they cannot yet afford.
        </p>
        <p>
          I disagree with this view.  While economic development is vital, ignoring environmental issues will ultimately undermine the very
          prosperity we seek.  Climate change, pollution and resource depletion threaten agriculture, human health and infrastructure.  Investing
          in renewable energy, clean technologies and sustainable practices can create employment while protecting the planet.  Therefore,
          economic progress and environmental stewardship are not mutually exclusive; they must go hand in hand.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Plastic waste has become a global problem. What are the causes of this issue and what measures can be taken to solve it?</p>
        <p>
          Plastic waste accumulates because disposable packaging is ubiquitous and often cheaper than sustainable alternatives.  Many consumers
          are unaware of or indifferent to the environmental impact of their purchases, and recycling infrastructure is inadequate in many countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address this issue, governments should introduce regulations that limit single‑use plastics and incentivise companies to develop
          biodegradable packaging.  Public awareness campaigns can encourage consumers to carry reusable bags and bottles.  Additionally,
          investment in recycling facilities and research into alternative materials will reduce the amount of plastic waste entering landfills
          and oceans.  Through concerted effort, the global community can mitigate the plastic waste crisis.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Some people think that teachers should be replaced by computers in the classroom, while others believe that human teachers are essential. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</p>
        <p>
          Proponents of using computers in place of teachers argue that technology can deliver information more efficiently and consistently.  Digital platforms
          offer interactive simulations and personalised feedback that can be accessed anytime.  In remote or disadvantaged areas where qualified teachers are scarce,
          computer‑based learning might provide access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, teaching is far more than dispensing information.  Human teachers nurture critical thinking, adapt lessons to students’ emotional and social
          needs, and inspire curiosity.  They create a supportive classroom environment and provide mentorship that machines cannot replicate.  Furthermore,
          over‑reliance on technology can widen the digital divide, disadvantaging students who lack access to devices or reliable internet.  In my view,
          while computers are invaluable educational tools, they should complement rather than replace human teachers.  A blended approach that combines
          the efficiency of technology with the empathy of skilled educators is the most effective way to foster comprehensive learning.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> In many countries, there is a shortage of new teachers in primary and secondary schools. What are the causes and what solutions can you suggest?</p>
        <p>
          There are several reasons why fewer graduates are entering the teaching profession.  First, teaching salaries are often
          lower than those offered in other sectors requiring similar levels of education, making the career less attractive.  Second,
          the workload can be overwhelming, with teachers expected to manage large classes, complete administrative tasks and cope with
          increasing behavioural issues.  Finally, the profession may suffer from a lack of status, discouraging talented individuals from
          considering it as a viable option.
        </p>
        <p>
          To tackle this problem, governments could increase funding to raise teachers’ pay and improve working conditions.  Providing
          opportunities for professional development and clear career progression would also make the job more appealing.  Additionally,
          public awareness campaigns that highlight the importance and rewards of teaching could elevate its status.  By implementing
          these measures, more capable graduates might be encouraged to pursue teaching, helping to ease the shortage.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 1 – Opinion</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Technology will eventually replace most human jobs. Do you agree or disagree?</p>
        <p>
          Some commentators predict that automation and artificial intelligence will render the majority of human workers obsolete.  Machines
          can now perform routine tasks faster and more accurately than people, and algorithms are encroaching even on white‑collar professions
          such as accounting and journalism.  It is therefore understandable that many fear widespread unemployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not, however, believe that humans will become irrelevant.  Firstly, technological change also creates new kinds of employment —
          jobs in programming, data analysis, design and maintenance did not exist a few decades ago.  Secondly, many roles require empathy,
          creativity and complex decision‑making that machines cannot replicate.  For instance, teachers, nurses and artists fulfil social
          needs beyond the scope of automation.  In conclusion, while technology will transform the labour market, it is unlikely to
          eliminate the need for human workers entirely.

      <h3>Band 9 Sample Essay 2 – Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
      <div class="essay">
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Many children spend too much time on screen‑based activities. What problems does this cause and what solutions can you suggest?</p>
        <p>
          Excessive screen time among children can lead to a host of problems.  Physically, spending hours staring at screens is linked to
          eye strain and sedentary lifestyles, contributing to obesity.  Mentally, constant exposure to fast‑paced digital stimuli may reduce
          attention spans and impair social skills.  Moreover, online environments can expose young users to inappropriate content or cyberbullying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents and educators need to work together to mitigate these issues.  Setting clear limits on screen time and encouraging outdoor
          activities can help children maintain a healthy balance.  Schools could integrate digital literacy programmes that teach young people
          about online safety and the importance of real‑world interactions.  Manufacturers of apps and games should also incorporate prompts
          for breaks and educational content.  By adopting these strategies, we can ensure that digital technology enriches rather than harms
          children’s lives.

      <h4>Describe a place in nature that you enjoy visiting.</h4>
      <p>One of my favourite places in nature is a local wetland.  It has a rich <em>ecosystem</em> and is home to diverse wildlife.  I often go there to walk along the trails and watch birds migrate in the spring.  The area is protected, so the natural <em>habitat</em> is preserved, and the government has taken steps to combat <em>climate change</em> by planting trees and educating visitors【502125107021774†L400-L443】.  I find the tranquillity of the wetlands helps me to stay <strong>resilient</strong> and focused.  It’s also a great place to practise mindfulness and reflect on environmental issues.</p>
      <h4>What technological device do you use most often?</h4>
      <p>The device I use most often is my smartphone.  It’s almost <em>ubiquitous</em> in modern life【717859448709721†L186-L193】.  I use it for communication, learning and entertainment.  Its <em>automation</em> features, such as reminders and note‑taking, help me stay organised.  However, I try to maintain a good work–life balance by setting limits on screen time, as I know excessive use can lead to a <strong>sedentary</strong> lifestyle.  Overall, I believe technology should be used thoughtfully so that it enhances productivity without becoming a <em>menace</em> to our health.</p>
